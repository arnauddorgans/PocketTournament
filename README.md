# Pocket Tournament – Beta Access Information

Hello Riot Team,

Thank you for reviewing our application. At this time, we do not have a public website URL available. However, we are actively working on our iOS app, **Pocket Tournament**, which is currently in beta.

## 🔍 What is Pocket Tournament?

Pocket Tournament is a mobile app designed to allow users to easily **organize**, **join**, and **manage** competitive gaming tournaments directly from their iPhone.

## 🚧 Current Status

- The app is currently in **beta** and under active development.
- We are using **mocked data** for all tournament-related features since we do not yet have access to the official Riot Tournament API.
- The user interface and core flows are functional and representative of the intended final experience.

## 📲 TestFlight Access

We would be happy to provide you with **TestFlight access** to the beta version so you can explore the app and evaluate the user experience.

If you're interested, please let us know which Apple ID(s) you'd like us to invite, and we’ll send over the TestFlight invitation immediately.

## 📬 Contact

If you need anything else or further information, feel free to reach out to us via this repository or by email.

Thank you again for your time and consideration!

— The Pocket Tournament Team
